# spine-c-sokol

I have no idea what I'm doing. But I attempt to build a [sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol)-based renderer for [Spine2D](http://esotericsoftware.com/).
Example Spine2D projects under `spine-exmaples` are taken from http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-examples.

## Dependencies

- [spine-c](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/4.0/spine-c)
- [sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol)

## Limitations

It doesn't work at all, LOL.
